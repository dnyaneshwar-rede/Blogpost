# Introduction to Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is revolutionizing various industries by providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized way to record transactions. 

## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This ensures the integrity and transparency of data.

### Key Features of Blockchain

- **Decentralization**: No central authority or single point of failure.
- **Transparency**: Transactions are visible to all participants.
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, transactions cannot be changed or deleted.

### How Does Blockchain Work?

1. **Transaction Initiation**: A user initiates a transaction.
2. **Block Creation**: The transaction is grouped with other transactions into a block.
3. **Consensus**: Network participants validate the block.
4. **Block Addition**: The validated block is added to the blockchain.
5. **Confirmation**: The transaction is confirmed and cannot be altered.

### Example Code

Here is a simple example of how you might create a basic blockchain in Python:

<CodeBlock language="python">
{`class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.create_block(previous_hash='1', proof=100)

    def create_block(self, proof, previous_hash):
        block = {
            'index': len(self.chain) + 1,
            'timestamp': str(datetime.now()),
            'proof': proof,
            'previous_hash': previous_hash
        }
        self.chain.append(block)
        return block

    def get_previous_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]
`}
</CodeBlock>

### Real-World Applications

Blockchain technology is used in various domains, such as:

- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Tracking goods from origin to destination.
- **Healthcare**: Securing patient data and improving accessibility.

### Conclusion

Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to many issues related to data integrity, security, and transparency. As the technology evolves, its applications are expected to expand even further.
